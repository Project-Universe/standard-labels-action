## Contributing to this project

To add a new label, update the `labels.json` file and the GitHub Action will do the rest for everyone!

```json
[
    {
        "name": "good first issue",
        "color": "7f0799"
    },
    {
        "name": "ðŸ’¬ talk: discussion",
        "color": "f9bbe5"
    } 
]
```

> This example shows two common ways to add a label. One without emoji and the other with emoji. Preferred way is the one with emoji at the beginning but there are also some labels which are commonly used without emojis.
